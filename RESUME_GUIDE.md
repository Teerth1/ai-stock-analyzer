## Interview Talking Points

When asked about this project, mention:

### 1. What the project does
*"I built an automated stock trading bot that uses AI to analyze financial news and make trading decisions. It uses FinBERT, which is a BERT model specifically trained on financial texts, to understand whether news is bullish or bearish."*

### 2. Why FinBERT vs simpler approaches
*"Initially, I used VADER, which is a rule-based sentiment analyzer, but I upgraded to FinBERT because it understands financial context much better. For example, 'debt decreased' would be negative in VADER but positive in a financial context, and FinBERT gets that right."*

### 3. Technical implementation
*"The bot fetches news from NewsAPI, processes it through the FinBERT transformer model using PyTorch, calculates an average sentiment score, and then executes trades via the Alpaca API based on configurable thresholds."*

### 4. What you learned
*"I learned how to work with pre-trained transformer models, integrate multiple APIs, handle real-time data, and design trading logic with proper risk management. I also learned about the differences between rule-based NLP and deep learning approaches."*

### 5. Future improvements (shows initiative)
*"I'm planning to add Phase 2, which includes price prediction using Random Forest, technical indicators like RSI and MACD, and a backtesting framework to validate strategies on historical data."*

## Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does FinBERT work?"
**A:** *"FinBERT is a BERT model that was pre-trained on general language, then fine-tuned specifically on financial news and reports. It uses transformers and attention mechanisms to understand context in text. When I pass it a news headline, it outputs probabilities for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment, and I convert that to a score from -1 to +1."*

### Q: "How do you prevent the bot from making bad trades?"
**A:** *"I implemented several safeguards: First, it requires at least 3 news articles before making a decision. Second, it uses a sentiment threshold (0.15) so it only trades on strong signals. Third, it's currently set to paper trading only, so no real money is at risk while testing."*

### Q: "What would you improve?"
**A:** *"I'd add Phase 2 with price prediction using machine learning, incorporate technical indicators like RSI and MACD, build a backtesting framework to test on historical data, and add more sophisticated risk management like position sizing and stop losses."*

### Q: "Why Python for this project?"
**A:** *"Python has excellent libraries for machine learning (PyTorch, scikit-learn, transformers) and financial data (yfinance, alpaca-trade-api). It's also great for rapid prototyping and has strong community support for AI/ML projects."*
